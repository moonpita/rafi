        p.acontent__text In 2023, I received a game-changing job offer â€“ a project manager position in an apartment complex project in Bali. Excited and eager to dive in, I quickly realized the challenges ahead.<br><br> Starting the project from scratch, I needed to find contractors. However, even for a simple task like a topographic survey, it was difficult because there was no resource to find information. I had to rely on word of mouth and intensive networking, which consumed a lot of my time.<br><br>The biggest challenge was the significant differences in prices among contractors, making it impossible to define an average market price. For the same service, I received offers ranging from $200 to $600. The same was true for prices for technical inspections, soil tests, concept design development, MEP design, etc.<br><br>Similarly, when building our family villa, finding a reliable contractor with affordable prices was tough due to the lack of references. Figuring out the budget was equally challenging, as prices suggested by different contractors varied significantly. In other words, I faced a high level of uncertainty that made decision-making almost impossible.<br><br>Struggling with all these challenges, I thought, 'It would be very helpful to have all this information in one place.' That's when the idea to create a platform that simplifies construction projects, makes the market more transparent, and helps people collaborate to establish trustworthy partnerships came to me.
